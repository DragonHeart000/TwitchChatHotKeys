# TwitchChatHotKeys
TwitchChatHotKeys is a program that allows Twitch Streamers to bind any key on their keybaord to say anything in twitch chat. Most common uses would be for running a commercial, moderating chat with timeouts/bans, or putting chat in followers/subscribers only mode, but anything can be done with it.
